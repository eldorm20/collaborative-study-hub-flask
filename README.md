## About the Project

Provide a more detailed explanation of your project. Expand on the initial description. Mention the technologies used (Flask, Jinja2, SQLite or your database, etc.). Highlight the goals and vision of the study hub.

## Getting Started

This section guides users on how to get a local copy of the project up and running on their machine.

### Prerequisites

List the software that needs to be installed before running the project. Be specific with versions if necessary.

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (usually comes with Python)
* (Optional) [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (recommended for environment isolation)
* (Your Database - e.g., SQLite - usually doesn't require separate installation, but mention if you're using something else like PostgreSQL or MySQL)

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing your project's dependencies. You can generate this using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your Flask and other libraries.)*

## Setup

### Database Setup

This application uses a PostgreSQL database. To set it up, follow these steps:

1.  **Install PostgreSQL:** If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, you'll need to download and install it for your operating system. You can find instructions on the official PostgreSQL website: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

2.  **Create the Database:** Once PostgreSQL is installed and running, you need to create the database that this application will use. You can do this using the `psql` command-line tool or a graphical administration tool like pgAdmin.

    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
    \q
    ```

    *(Replace `your_database_name` with your desired database name, e.g., `study_hub_db`.)*

3.  **Install the PostgreSQL Adapter:** You'll need a Python library to connect to PostgreSQL. Install `psycopg2`:

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

4.  **Configure Database Connection:** The connection details for your PostgreSQL database will be specified using an environment variable (see the next section).

### Environment Variables

This application relies on environment variables for configuration, including the database connection details. You should create a `.env` file in the root of the project and define the following variables:
