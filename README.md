## About the Project

Provide a more detailed explanation of your project. Expand on the initial description. Mention the technologies used (Flask, Jinja2, SQLite or your database, etc.). Highlight the goals and vision of the study hub.

## Getting Started

This section guides users on how to get a local copy of the project up and running on their machine.

### Prerequisites

List the software that needs to be installed before running the project. Be specific with versions if necessary.

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (usually comes with Python)
* (Optional) [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (recommended for environment isolation)
* (Your Database - e.g., SQLite - usually doesn't require separate installation, but mention if you're using something else like PostgreSQL or MySQL)

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing your project's dependencies. You can generate this using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your Flask and other libraries.)*

## Setup

Explain any specific setup steps required for your application.

### Database Setup

If your application uses a database (like SQLite, which might be the simplest for a basic project), explain how it's initialized.

* **(For SQLite):** Mention that Flask-SQLAlchemy (if you're using it) or your database interaction code will likely create the database file (e.g., `site.db`) automatically in the project directory upon the first run.
* **(For other databases):** Provide instructions on how to set up the database server, create the database, and configure any necessary connection details.

### Environment Variables (Optional)

If your application uses environment variables for configuration (e.g., database URLs, API keys), explain how to create and set them (e.g., using a `.env` file and a library like `python-dotenv`).
