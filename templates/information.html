        <h2>About {{ app_name }}</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Collaborative Study Hub! This platform is designed to be a central place for students to share and access learning resources for their courses.</p>
        <p>Our aim is to foster a community of learners who support each other by providing notes, summaries, links to helpful materials, and a space to ask and answer questions.</p>

        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browse Courses:</strong> On the homepage, you'll find a list of available courses based on the resources that have been uploaded.</li>
            <li><strong>Course Dashboard:</strong> Clicking on a course will take you to its dedicated dashboard, where you can find a list of shared resources and recent questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Share Resources:</strong> If you have helpful study materials, you can upload them to the relevant course page.</li>
            <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> If you're stuck on a topic, feel free to ask your questions in the course's Q&A section.</li>
            <li><strong>Help Others:</strong> If you know the answer to a question, please contribute by sharing your knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>User Profiles:</strong> (Coming Soon) In the future, you'll be able to see your contributions and manage your profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To create a free and accessible repository of study materials.</li>
            <li>To facilitate peer-to-peer learning and support.</li>
            <li>To make studying more efficient and collaborative.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thank you for being a part of the Collaborative Study Hub!</p>
